DATA

contains data files from different trajectories of the preclinical research chain

equiv		# decision criterion from stage 1 (exploratory study) to stage 2 (confirmatory study) is based on an equivalence test 

sig		# decision criterion from stage 1 (exploratory study) to stage 2 (confirmatory study) is based on a significance threshold of .05

method 1	# approach to determine the sample size for a replication study is a safeguard power analysis

method 2	# approach to determine the sample size for a replication study is a standard power analysis using the initial effect size (from exploratory study)

method 3	# approach to determine the sample size for a replication study is a standard power analysis using the smallest effect size of interest (SESOI); for now .3

seq		# experimental design applied in confirmatory study is a 3-stage sequential design using an O'Brien-Fleming-like alpha spending function for an alpha of .05

fixN		# experimental design applied in confirmatory study is a fixed-N design using a significance threshold of .05


##### Variables in the data sets #####

### Sequential designs

rep_no		# number of the experiment that was selected for replication (between 1 and 10000)

ES_true		# true effect size drawn from the population of effect sizes

totalN		# maximum number of subjects available for testing (in *each* group)

nstage		# number of subjects (in *each* group) used for interim analysis at a certain stage

beta		# type II error used for calculation of bounds in gsDesign (.2 for now)

d_emp		# empirical standardized effect computed from simulated values

t_value		# t-statistic that is computed at each stage

p_value		# p-value computed at each stage 

df		# degrees of freedom that are calculated by t.test() because of unequal variances in the 2 groups

stage		# stage in which an interim analysis was performed

H0		# indicates whether trial was stopped for success (= 2), futility (= 1), or was continued to the next stage (= 0)

prev_pop	# prevalence of SESOI (.3 for now) in the population

rep_attempts	# number of replication attempts, i.e. exploratory studies that proceed to the confirmatory stage

false_omission_rate	# percentage of ES > .3 in the experiments that were NOT selected for replication

true_selection_rate	# percentage of ES > .3 in the experiments that were selected for replication



### Fixed-N designs

rep_no		# number of the experiment that was selected for replication (between 1 and 10000)

ES_true		# true effect size drawn from the population of effect sizes

totalN		# maximum number of subjects available for testing

mean_control	# mean of the control group

mean_treatment	# mean of the treatment group

d_emp		# empirical standardized effect computed from simulated values computed from mean_control and mean_treatment

p_value		# p-value computed at each stage 

pref_pop	# prevalence of SESOI (.3 for now) in the population

rep_attempts	# number of replication attempts, i.e. exploratory studies that proceed to the confirmatory stage

false_omission_rate	# percentage of ES > .3 in the experiments that were NOT selected for replication

true_selection_rate	# percentage of ES > .3 in the experiments that were selected for replication
